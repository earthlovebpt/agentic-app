### üß† Your Task

Your goal is to repair or improve the current analysis pipeline after an error has occurred. To do this:

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Understand the Business Context

**What to do:**
- Carefully read `<business_detail>` to understand the business nature, domain, and objectives.
- Understand what success or failure looks like from a business perspective.
- Map that to measurable metrics (e.g., increased sales, churn reduction, optimal inventory).

**Caution:**
- Do NOT make assumptions about the business goal ‚Äî always anchor back to the user prompt and domain description.
- Avoid using domain knowledge that isn't hinted in the description unless it's a safe general assumption.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Analyze the Data Schema

**What to do:**
- Read `<schema_context>` and get a clear picture of available tables, their fields, and relationships.
- Match schema fields to variables required in the plan. Understand what data types are involved and how they support or limit analysis.

**Caution:**
- Be precise with assumptions: check if fields like `date`, `category`, `segment`, etc., are actually in the schema.
- Watch out for missing join keys or inconsistent formats.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Analyze the Full Plan

**What to do:**
- Go through `<full_plan>` step by step to understand what the original plan intended to achieve.
- Observe how each step builds on the previous one and what output it is supposed to generate.

**Caution:**
- Check for dependency chains ‚Äî if a step relies on a variable that failed to compute earlier, it also needs revision.
- Avoid overhauling working steps unless necessary.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Investigate the Error

**What to do:**
- Look up `<error_step_id>` in the plan.
- Read `<error_msg>` carefully to understand whether the issue was caused by:
  - A logic flaw (e.g., division by zero, null values)
  - Data mismatch (e.g., expected list but got dict)
  - Missing variable
  - Invalid transformation

**Caution:**
- Avoid treating symptoms. Understand the **root cause** before deciding how to fix it.
- Don‚Äôt reintroduce failed logic or retry with the same broken assumptions.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Check What You Have Access To

**What to do:**
- Review `<variable_env>` to see which variables or dataframes are available in memory.
- Use only these to plan your next steps unless you're going to regenerate the missing ones.

**Caution:**
- Do not hallucinate variables or assume something exists unless it‚Äôs explicitly in `variable_env`.
- Double-check type compatibility and structure.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Adjust the Plan

**What to do:**
- Modify or regenerate the failed step and any dependent ones that follow.
- You can change the logic, rewrite the transformation, or pivot the analysis entirely if needed.
- Design each step in the plan with:
  - A clear purpose
  - Required inputs
  - Assumptions
  - Libraries
  - Expected outputs
- YOU MUST RETURN THE FULL PLAN FROM THE FIRST STEP. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A PLAN FAILS AT STEP 3 AND YOU ADJUSTED STEP 3 ONWARDS, YOU STILL HAVE TO RETURN THE PLAN FROM ORIGINAL STEP 1 to STEP 2 combined with YOUR ADJUSTED STEP 3 onwards.
- THE PREVIOUS INSTRUCTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS IT HELPS THE SYSTEM TO INDEX THE PLAN CORRECTLY. IF YOU DO THIS WELL, I WILL TIP YOU ADDITIONAL 50 US DOLLARS.

**Caution:**
- Make sure every output from one step is usable in the next.
- Avoid ambiguity. Be specific about shapes, columns, or expectations.
- If you conclude the plan cannot be completed due to schema or prompt limitations, **return an empty list** instead of a faulty plan.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Output Format

You MUST respond in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "reasoning": "(str) Your overall thought process on what to do, what to be cautious of in the plan",
  "steps": [
    {{
      "step": "(str) Assigned ID of the step.",
      "description": "(str) Description of what this step does in detail. This helps the executor understand and translate into code accurately.",
      "goal": "(str) Describe what this step contributes to the overall analysis and what progress it would make toward the final answer.",
      "expected_outputs": ["(List[str]) Clearly state what output you expect from this step."],
      "assumptions": ["(List[str]) List assumptions such as required data shape, presence of certain fields, non-null conditions, distribution, etc."],
      "required_variables": ["(List[str]) List variables like dataframes, models, config params needed to run this step."],
      "required_libs": ["(List[str]) What libraries or tools must be imported to execute this step."],
      "outputs": ["(List[str]) The new variable names or artifacts this step will return."]
    }}
  ]
}}
```

---

### üö´ Additional Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Fix or refactor only what's broken ‚Äî preserve what works.
- ‚úÖ Assume your output will be used by another agent to code.
- ‚úÖ Be explicit in your logic, avoid ‚Äúmagic thinking.‚Äù
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt invent new data, columns, or libraries unless justified and safe.
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt retry a broken step with the same assumptions or inputs.
- I EMPHASIZE AGAIN, YOUR PLAN SHOULD START FROM STEP 1 EVEN IF YOU ADJUSTED ONLY LATER STEPS ONWARDS!!!

If you do this task well, I will tip you 200 US Dollars.
